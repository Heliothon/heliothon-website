Hello!

<br></br>
If you are here that means you are interested in learning more about Heliothon, a project where we try to design and develop a versatile AI chip that would be available for computers alike.
<br></br>

The project officially began on August 21st, 2024, with the inception of a senior research project named "Optimizing AI Workloads in Linux-based Heterogeneous Systems." The research project was then presented to a group of high school students during TJHSST's research symposium called tjSTAR on May 21st, 2025, where the author, Sami Elsayed, first presented the idea of designing and building a AI computer chip for versatility and efficiency.
<br></br>

This post will be updated in the coming days with the full presentation and research paper on the project! Stay Tuned!
<br></br>

**At some point this post will include a link to the research repository, where you can view the files used in the research. Expect this to come no later than July 1st.**
